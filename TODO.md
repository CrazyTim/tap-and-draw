# todo list

- Play a sound when changing the word, so group can hear if they are cheating.

- instead of a single word, show three, one from each difficulty. Player can choose which one they want to draw.

- To avoid accidentally tapping the screen during countdown:
  - User should tap and hold timer button for a second to cancel it.
  - Tapping any other button does nothing except pulse-animate the timer button to indicate it is the only active button.

- Fav icon.

- More words (obviously)

- Support for different languages.

- Hint button with example images for each word.
  - only show hint button if example jpg exists [refer here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3915634/checking-if-a-url-is-broken-in-javascript).

- Rate the difficulty, submit your own rating on a word to reclassify it if you think its not in the correct level (words would just be reclassified manually by admin).
