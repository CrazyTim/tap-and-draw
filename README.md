# Tap And Draw

A simple web app to help you play pictionary! Like if you're on holiday and forgot to bring pictionary with you :).

## Features
- 3 different levels of difficulty.
- Randomises words in each level. Doesn't repeat a word until all words have been seen.
- Nice animations.
- Designed to be used on mobile phones - simple interface with as few taps as possible.
- Press the android back button to exit out of dialogues (uses JavaScript history API)
- Words are hopefully interesting to draw, and were chosen to be not specific to a particular country (appeals to a wider audience).
